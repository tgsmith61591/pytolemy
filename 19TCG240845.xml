      <abstract>This data set consists of 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot), 4-band (R, G, B, IR) orthoimages covering the urban area footprint.  An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 1.52-meters NSSDA 95% confidence (0.88-meters Root Mean Squared (RMSE) Error XY (0.62 meter RMSE X or Y).  Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is UTM Zone 19N with a NAD83 (2011) datum. The naming convention is based on the U. S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data depicts geographic features on the surface of the earth.  It was created to provide easily accessible geospatial data which is readily available to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as plan for homeland security efforts.  This data also supports The National Map.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived.   This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements.  Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected.  Seamline mismatches are not corrected unless the overall displacement exceeds 0.6 meters.</logic>
    <complete>Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free. Imagery acquisition during leaf-on conditions was approved.</complete>

Given its location a control is needed in this area and it was agreed upon that checkpoint QC-22 13031S could be used instead. GC-09 13031F would still be able to be used as a vertical checkpoint; however, the shadows over it would prohibit the horizontal measurement of the point.</srccontr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The digital orthophotography is comprised of a 24 bit, RGBN bands, 30cm pixel resolution ground and true orthos covering the Boston/Providence, MA project area.  The imagery was acquired on April 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, and 26, 2013.  The Pixel Factory process was used in the generation of the orthoimagery covering all project tiles.  The rectification process was then run using the processed DSM on each flight line. The quicklook (reduced resolution rectification) of each flight line are exported out of Pixel Factory.   Radiometric adjustments were made to the quicklooks using Fugro proprietary tools. The radiometrically balanced imagery was then re-imported into the Pixel Factory system and the histogram from the quicklook was applied to the full resolution imagery.  Mosaic lines were placed, joining the ADS80 imagery strips. An initial QA/QC was performed by the technician to ensure that the mosaic lines were appropriately placed and that there was appropriate imagery coverage. The final imagery data set is removed from the Pixel Factory environment in a process called "packaging" where the individual tiles are created. All data processing in the Pixel Factory system is performed in UTM Zone 19N meters; it is during packaging that final datum and projection are defined. The created tiles are reviewed to ensure the output was successful and ground control points are measured and verified for accuracy.  QA/QC was performed looking for anomalies, smears and other indications of problems within the digital orthophoto creation process, and interactive radiometric adjustment applied where needed. Additional global radiometric adjustments were applied to the completed orthos in Adobe Photoshop to enhance the color and/or contrast as needed.  The final digital ortho products were delivered in GeoTIFF format.</procdesc>
